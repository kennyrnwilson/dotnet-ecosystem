# Dot Net Eco System

.NET is a cross platform open source developer platform. The complete documentation can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/introduction) . To build applications we need a version of the .NET SDK and to run applications built using .NET we need a version of the .NET runtime. Different versions of the runtime and the SDK can be found [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet). .NET Applications have built in support for 

 * Dependency Injection (DI)
 * Configuration
 * Logging 
 * Options

## CLI
Everything needed to build, test, and run .net core applications is provided via the .NET Core
Command-line Interface CLI.

Whenever we install a version of the .NET SDK we get the .NET CLI. On windows the default location of the CLI is 

```
C:\Program Files\dotnet
```
